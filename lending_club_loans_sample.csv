My position is âSpecialistâ I am responsible for database management and training of our largest asset management system (Maximo).  I enter work orders and track preventative maintenance items to keep our 6000 plus assets running smoothly. I also double as the Plant Managersâ personal assistant, due to my past experience as a VP assistant at Morgan Stanley.<br/>My monthly costs are split between my husband and myself. My share of the budget is equal to about $2200.00 monthly including mortgage and all other utilities and childcare etc. <br/>My credit cards are my solely my responsibility and I would like to consolidate them and pay them off at a lower interest rate. The first two will be paid off by this loan. The listed amounts are what I pay per month, not the minimum allowed. My salary is more than adequate to support the monthly payment of$ 647.97<br/>American express blue $8300.00 @15.21 %	 monthly payment $500.00<br/>Chase $16,000 (12k of it was from the purchase of a car) @17.24 %   	 monthly payment $350.00<br/>Discover card $5.000 @5.9% 	monthly payment $116.00<br/>I have never had a delinquent account and have an unblemished credit record with Fico scores ranging from 720 to 787. Iâm never late, and have paid off debt on or before schedule. I plan to pay off this loan in 2 years 3 months.<br/>We are a two wage earner household and our combined income is 125K a year. We have retirement plans that we do not wish to touch for these debts. Credit card debt is not an emergency. It would just be a great convenience to have my interest rates reduced. I have contacted the credit card companies and they said they can only reduce it by Â½ %. That is why I applied for this loan.<br/>The loan will be automatically deducted from my checking account. I have direct deposit and $2800.00 overdraft protection. There will never be an issue with late payments, I am paid on the 15th and 30th.<br/>I will also be sending a second payment of $200.00 to be applied to the principal every month. Which I will also have deducted automatically. The purpose of this loan was to save on interest and with this accelerated payback schedule I will save myself several thousand dollars.  <br/>I hope that I have answered many of your questions.

I have been a faithful customer and have never once missed a payment on a debt, but high interest rates have kept them nearly impossible to pay off. I got in trouble back in college before I knew what damage credit cards could do, and haven't been able to dig my way out. I recently cut up every credit card I had; this was an amazing feeling! I have a B.A. in Psychology and am currently employed by the state of Missouri as a Youth Specialist. I work in a moderate security treatment center to help rehabilitate young men who have had some trouble with the law. I love my job and plan to stick with it as a career. I also substitute teach for the local public school system on the days that I don't work at the treatment center, which is a nice bit of additional income. I hope to get rid of my credit cards so I can buy a house before too long. My girlfriend (soon to be fiance) would like me to have control over my credit situation before we move in together, so I am hoping this will be one of the solutions! Thank you so much!  Borrower added on 03/09/11 > One final note: I have watched Dave Ramsey's DVDs and am already following his suggestions. I used my tax return to pay off my two credit cards with the lowest balances. This loan will be used for the remainder. I will add about $75 to the minimum monthly payment of this loan, which is what I was paying on those other two. This should expedite the payoff process.<br/> Borrower added on 03/15/11 > Okay, another note: I had my student loan payments reduced and I will be throwing the difference at this loan as well, which should mean an additional $80 a month. Again, I am incredibly serious about getting rid of my credit cards. This needs to happen.

Everything is place, we need the loan to as a safeguard against anything that might happen and unbuckle the economy.  Thanks again for all your help!<br/> 589147 added on 12/11/09 > Update:  wow this is really working!  Thanks for looking at my loan.  To flesh out the above:  I had everything in place to get married last year, target date Labor Day 2009.  I had the ring 95% saved for, and my wedding was about 90% of the budget we had targeted.  The only thing that I didn't save for was the honeymoon, but I figured at the time (December 2008) that I would have 9 months to save for the honeymoon (we weren't even sure where we wanted to go).<br/><br/>Then, the economy started to dive.  My future fiancee worked at a bank that went under.  My job went away as my company downsized.  We're both in our early thirties and we both owned our own houses.  It took me a year to find a new job (consultant).  My future fiancee should be getting a job in January (needs to be internally approved because of budget).  <br/><br/>Though we are both traditionalists, we had to move in together early to save on costs, as she could not afford her COBRA payment and her mortgage.  We were able to rent out her place at a $500 month loss, because she is completely upside-down on her loan as her property value completely tanked.  <br/><br/>My plan now is to keep as much cash on hand as possible just in case.  The economy looks better, but both of our employment futures are dependent on our respective companies staying financially healthy.  As a consultant, I am well aware that my position will be the first to be cut if the economy tanks again.  I specialize in IT functions for the insurance industry, and our industry has shown weakness in this area.  My girlfriend's position depends on her department's budget being approved for the next fiscal year.  They tried to bring her in this year, but management wanted to approve all budgets and closed hiring early.<br/><br/>We've scaled back our wedding plans a little bit, just in case everything hits the fan.  If I get laid off, too, then I can put her on my COBRA, as my current assignment is slated until at least 10/2010, and we plan on being married before that.<br/><br/>Until now, I have used a good portion of the wedding fund to keep up with our student loans, mortgage, and car payments.  Both of our parents are retired and on fixed incomes.  We have credit cards, but I want to use those sparingly because our rates have been jacked up and our lines of credit decreased.  It has been struggle to keep up with our costs and having enough to have a nice wedding, but forgoing all luxuries and making good use of the local library has made it bearable.  Knowing that I can be married soon to the woman I love has made it all the worthwhile.<br/>",wedding,please help me get married,601xx,IL,21.32,1.0,Dec-1996,680.0,684.0,2.0,2.0,,9.0,0.0,21476.0,37.9,28.0,f,0.0,0.0,12229.6915137723,12168.54,9999.99,2229.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,Dec-2012,373.91,,Apr-2018,749.0,745.0,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

I have an excellent credit score of 776 and a stellar repayment history with absolutely no derogatory items. I pay all bills on time and always have, as my credit report indicates. Building a solid credit history has been a top priority for me, and I've worked hard to ensure this happens. I fully paid off one student loan some years ago and am working on paying down the other. My budget plan will allow me to aggressively pay off my credit card balances in less than 8 months. My monthly budget outline is as follows:<br/><br/>Net Monthly Income: $2948.92<br/><br/>Rent/Renter&rsquo;s Insurance: $615<br/>Groceries/Misc. Household goods: $480<br/>Household Utilities: $116<br/>Transportation (public transit fare): $86<br/>Cell Phone: $88<br/>Student Loan: $100<br/>Credit Card/Consumer Debt Re-payment: $615<br/>Contribution to Savings Account: $100<br/><br/>Remaining: $784.92<br/><br/>Given the above budget, I am more than capable of managing the ~$241 monthly payment of the loan I&rsquo;m requesting. Doing so, I&rsquo;m still left with approximately $545 per month for entertainment and other incidentals. <br/><br/>I work for a well-established importing/distribution company that has been in business for over 20 years. I started with the company in March of 2010 after spending 6+ years with my previous employer and have already been promoted to a higher-paying position with increased responsibility after just 15 months. The company is growing annually and I am thrilled to be part of such a successful, forward-moving organization.<br/><br/>Thank you in advance for considering funding my loan request. I appreciate your support!<br/>",wedding,Wedding Loan,606xx,IL,4.69,0.0,Nov-1997,775.0,779.0,1.0,,,8.0,0.0,4735.0,12.3,22.0,f,0.0,0.0,8686.027508168401,8686.03,8000.0,686.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jun-2014,251.74,,Sep-2015,804.0,800.0,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

Thus a 10-year old truck (in great shape) is the move for me. I build very high-end custom cars for a living, so basic maintenance and repairs are cheaper than a new car payment.<br/><br/>I'm asking for a 36 month loan to provide flexibility, and to ensure I have some fiscal security, by keeping liquidity in my savings.<br/> Borrower added on 01/30/11 > I'm purchasing a 2001 Dodge Diesel to tow my personal vehicle builds, and take fishing trips into the sierra nevada mountains. <br/><br/>I was approved to buy a 2011 F250, but I'm too fiscally responsible to purchase a $45,000 truck which I will only drive 5,000-8,000 miles a year. A clean 10-year old truck is a better choice for someone such as myself. <br/><br/>I have a stable job, working as a program manager at a leading automotive engineering research and development firm. My reasoning for wanting a loan vs. paying cash is that I want to keep my security by having liquid assets. <br/><br/>This also means if I were to loose my job (something I do not foresee happening anytime soon) I will have enough money in savings to pay back this loan for 7 months without any financial hardship.<br/>",car,Used Dodge Diesel Tow Rig,950xx,CA,2.79,1.0,Dec-1999,710.0,714.0,0.0,17.0,,5.0,0.0,4811.0,20.0,8.0,f,0.0,0.0,9153.5517205197,9153.55,8000.0,1153.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,Aug-2013,1420.77,,Aug-2013,719.0,715.0,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

When I was in graduate school, I put myself in further debt by using my credit cards as a way to pay some of my expenses. Additionally, between graduation and beginning my job, I incurred medical expenses that I did not yet have insurance for.  That, plus high interest rates and voila - my situation! <br/><br/>I am a good candidate for this loan because I have already paid down my credit card debt by almost half. The only other debt I currently have is my home, my car,  and my student loans which are all in good standing and paid on time.  However, the interest rate I am still paying is making it hard for me to make a dent as quickly as I'd like.  As you can tell from my credit score, my lack of delinquencies, my debt to income, etc. I take my credit and paying back as quickly as I can very seriously. I chose the shortest loan option, but intend on paying it back as quickly as I absolutely can. Thank you for considering me!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Consolidate Loan,750xx,TX,17.65,3.0,Aug-1997,700.0,704.0,4.0,14.0,,14.0,0.0,16230.0,52.0,27.0,f,0.0,0.0,20912.6135059836,20851.11,16999.99,3912.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,Oct-2013,622.25,Nov-2013,Sep-2018,754.0,750.0,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,
